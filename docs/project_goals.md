# Project Goals

## Purpose

The Game Stats Tracker project demonstrates the ability to design and implement workflows using relational and NoSQL databases. It also highlights skills in AWS, Python, modern data engineering tools, and advanced database administration techniques.

## Target Audience

- Recruiters for database engineering roles.
- Technical peers interested in PostgreSQL and Cassandra workflows.
- Hiring managers seeking candidates with strong DBA skills and experience in high availability.

## Deliverables

### 1. Data Engineering Deliverables

- Data pipelines integrating Riot API, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra.
- Detailed documentation comparing relational and NoSQL workflows.
- Data Sources to be used for analytics reports / dashboards

### 2. Cloud Infrastructure Deliverables

- **AWS-hosted database environments**:
  - PostgreSQL RDS: Demonstrating setup, configuration, and optimization.
  - Cassandra Keyspaces: Implementing scalable NoSQL architecture.

### 3. DBA Deliverables

- **High Availability Implementation**:

  - Set up a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) PostgreSQL RDS cluster to demonstrate fault tolerance and automatic failover.
  - Implement Cassandra replication to showcase distributed high availability.

- **Backup and Recovery**:

  - Configure automated backups and retention policies for PostgreSQL RDS and Cassandra.
  - Demonstrate restoration of a backup to a point-in-time.

- **Performance Tuning**:

  - Optimize PostgreSQL queries with indexing and explain plans.
  - Configure Cassandra read/write consistency levels for performance and reliability.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**:
  - Set up monitoring dashboards for database health using AWS CloudWatch for PostgreSQL and Cassandra metrics.
  - Implement alerts for threshold breaches (e.g., high CPU utilization, slow queries).
